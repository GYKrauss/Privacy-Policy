Privacy Policy for Dancing Robot Classroom Extension

Effective Date: [25-12-24]

This privacy policy describes how the Stubot Extension ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Chrome extension.

Information We Collect:

When you authenticate with your Google account, we collect the following information through the Google Classroom API:

*   Your Google user ID
*   Information about your Google Classroom courses, including course names and IDs.
*   Information about your assigned coursework, including assignment titles, descriptions, and due dates.

How We Collect Data:

We collect this data through the Google Classroom API after you explicitly grant our extension permission to access your Google Classroom data during the authentication process.

Why We Collect Data and How We Use It:

We collect this data solely to provide you with a summary of your upcoming assignments within the Dancing Robot Classroom Extension. We use your Google user ID to identify you and retrieve your relevant Google Classroom information. We then display this information within the extension's robot widget and use it to generate a concise summary of your upcoming assignments using the Google Gemini API.

Data Storage and Protection:

We do not store your Google Classroom data permanently. The authentication token is temporarily stored in your browser's memory while the extension is in use and is removed when you close your browser or uninstall the extension. Assignment data is only processed in real time to generate the summary and is not stored.

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

Third-Party Sharing:

We do not share your data with any third parties.

Your Rights:

You can revoke our extension's access to your Google Classroom data at any time by uninstalling the extension. This will remove any temporarily stored authentication tokens. You can also manage your Google account's app permissions through your Google account settings.

Contact Us:

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or our data practices, please contact us at arobotco@gmail.com.

Changes to This Privacy Policy:

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes.
